      <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>An e-ticketing system that allows customers to purchase concert and 
            performance tickets, select date and location of concert, purchase 
            ticket.In addition the system offers bundles to customers which
            allows them to search for transport such as bus and train, hotel
            room and restaurant.
        </p>
		
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>As a group we first came up with the idea of an eticket system. 
		   After consulting with our lecturer we decided we need to add extra 
		   features such as offering to search for Hotel, Transport and Restaurant. 
		   We then name our system EBundleMaster.  We first came up with a list of 
		   brief use cases, then we divided among each member of the team. I was 
		   tasked to write use cases on the following:
		   <ul>
		   <li>Account Log-In</li>
           <li>Search for concert/performance genre</li>
           <li>Search for restaurant</li>
           <li>Search for restaurant type</li>
           <li>Book Restaurant</li>
           <li>Confirm Booking Detail</li>
		   </ul> 
		   After writing brief use cases, I developed them into casual, then into fully-dressed. 
		   My team then conducted a critique on my fully-dressed use cases and gave their feedback and 
		   recommendations for improvement.I then made changes to each full-dressed use cases according 
		   to those feedback.  
		</p>
		
	  <h2>Search for restaurant</h2>
		<p>I chose Search for restaurant component to developed further on. I first identified the four types of nouns, i.e.
		<ul>
			<li>People - Customer</li>
			<li>Event - Search for Restaurant</li>
			<li>Place - Restaurant</li>
			<li>Thing - Table (to book a table)</li>
		</ul>
		   When I initially start writing code to do the search, I followed a similar approach to Rick's Guitar.
		   I started off with three Classes, Restaurant, RestaurantList and FindRestaurantTester.

        <img src="B-DomainModel.png" alt="Domain Model" width="900">

	  <h2>S.O.L.I.D Principles</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>S - Single-responsibility principle: A class should only have one reason to change</li>
			<li>O - Open-closed principle: A class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself</li>
			<li>L - Liskov subsitution principle: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base class</li>
			<li>I - Interface segregation principle: Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use</li>
			<li>D - Dependency Inversion principle: Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In my search for restauarant program, I have applied Single-responsibility principle
		   and Dependency Inversion principle by creating Restaurant and RestaurantList classes.			   
		   Restaurant class models a restaurant object and RestaurantList class in charge of storing and finding list
		   of restaurants.
		</p>	
		
	  <h2>Code Smells</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Primitive Obsession: Use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks.</li>
			<li>Type Safety: Ensures that program behaviors are well defined.</li>
			<li>Data Class: A class that contains only fields and crude methods for accessing them.</li>
			<li>Shotgun Surgery: making any modification requires to make many small changes to different classes.</li>
			<li>Feature Envy: A method accesses the data of another object more than its own data.</li>
			<li>Inappropriate Intimacy: One class uses the internal fields and methods of another class.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In my search for restauarant program, I have removed smells like Primitive Obssession and shotgun surgery by creating enum classes for
           Restaurant Type,restaurant location and restaurant name. This will ensure type safety and no need type casting. I have also used generic types
		   on my Restaurant object for better code re-usability.
    	</p>
	  <h2>Refactoring</h2>
		<p>Refactoring reduce the risk of introducing errors, improving code readability and reduced complexity. 
		   In my program I used encapsulate field (Restaurant Class), making attribute private and allows access to the field with getter and setter
			method. I also used enhanced for loop instead of an iterator. This improves the readability and clarity of my code.
		</p>
	  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The project has been interesting. As a team we collaborated well. We communicated since the start and we would meet often to discuss our
		   progress. We would also give feedback on each other's work which really helped when I was writing my use cases. I have learned to use 
		   new tool such as Github for version control and I found this very useful in tracking what I did previously. I learned that writing 
		   good and meaningful commit messages is very important as it allows others to understand what I have done. I also learned the importance of
			refactoring my code to make it readable and less complex.
