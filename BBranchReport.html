      <h2>Project Title</h2>
        <p>Ebundle Master</p>
      
      <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>An e-ticketing system that allows customers to purchase concert and 
            performance tickets, select date and location of concert, purchase 
            ticket.In addtion the system offers bundles to customers which 
            allows them to search for transport such as bus and train, hotel 
            room and restaurant.
        </p>
		
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>As a group we first came up with the idea of an eticket system. 
		   After consulting with our lecturer we decided we need to add extra 
		   features such as offering to search for Hotel, Transport and Restaurant. 
		   We then name our system EBundleMaster.  We first came up with a list of 
		   brief use cases, then we divided among each member of the team. I was 
		   tasked to write use cases for the following:
		   <ul>
		   <li>Account Log-In</li>
           <li>Search for concert/performance genre</li>
           <li>Search for restaurant</li>
           <li>Search for restaurant type</li>
           <li>Book Restaurant</li>
           <li>Confirm Booking Detail</li>
		   </ul> 
		</p>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>The project has been interesting. As a team we collabrated well. We comminucated since the start and we would meet to discuss our
			 progress.Learned to use new tool such as Github for version control and I found this very useful in tracking what I did previously. 
			 I learned that writing good and meaningful commit message is very important as it allows other team memebers to understands what I have done.
