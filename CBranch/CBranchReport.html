      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> As a group we first came of with an idea of a online booking ticket system. Then our lecturer suggested that we can add more functions to it
          to make it more unique so we added functions such as able to search and book for transports,
          hotels and restaurant. As a group we decided on the name eBundleMaster for our project.
          As a group we divided list of task for brief, casual and fully dressed use cases.
          I was tasked with Add to cart, Book Concert, Search for hotel, Select hotel location, Select check-in date,
          Select check-out date, Select room type, and book hotel (Brief and casual use case).
          For fully dressed use case i did Add to cart, Book concert, Search for hotel and Book hotel.
          For coding phase of the project I was tasked with with Search for Hotel.
          After the list of task has been divided amongst us, we first did brief use case for each use cases ,
          then the next stage we did casual use case for each use cases and the final stage is the
          fully dressed use case, for this we picked the most important use cases on our project.</p>

       <h2>Streamlined Object Modeling</h2>
       <ol>
          <li>People ==> Customer</li>
          <li>Event  ==> Search</li>
          <li>Thing  ==> Room</li>
          <li>Place  ==> Hotel</li>
       	
       </ol>

       <h2> Refactoring</h2>
       <ol>
           <li> Performed Code Analysis Using IntellJ, changes I made with Code Analyse: changed for loop in HotelList class to enhance loop, this improves efficency on searching.</li>
           <li> Removed unused imports.</li>
           <li> Encapsulation - Refactoring public attributes to private attributes, have public Access methods so outside world can see the instance variable
                and have public mutator methods so the outside world can change the variables, but under controlled conditions.</li>
           </ol>
      
      <h2>Code Smells</h2>
          <ol>
              <li> Created 3 enum class for nameOfHotel, roomType and county, I named the enum classes NameOfHotel, RoomType and County. The reason why I created the 3 enum classes is for type safety. That means that only values in NameOfHotel, RoomTypes and County enum classes are allowed.</li>
              <li> I also did Shotgun Surgery because I created 2 enum classes I have to make many small changes across Hotel,HotelList and FindHotelTester classes.</li>
              <li> Primitive Obsession - Got rid of some String types e.g initial nameOfhotel, roomType and county were type String is now enum type.</li>
              <li> I Added Switch statements and toString methods to enum classes for readability when it outputs data.</li>

          </ol>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
               <p>In conclusion, I think that this project is interesting and I enjoyed working on it.
                  As a group we worked very well together, we met up outside of class to work on the project,critique and help each other.
                  We helped each other when anyone of us encountered difficulties with the project.
                  There was good communication between team members. Also because we used HTMML to write up our uses cases and report it was a great
                  experience because I have not done it since first year as a module.</p>
